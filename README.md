Front-end developer

I am a junior front-end developer with a background in system administration (CISCO) and electronics. 
In August 2024, I successfully completed my exams at CodeCool as an independent student. 
Previously, I worked in building automation, specifically coordinating HVAC controls with buildings.
I maintained contact with both domestic and international clients and prepared documentation for handovers and training.

IT has always been a central part of my life. It is everywhere around us.
I aim to understand this world better and take a more active role in its development.
