<h3 align="left">Connect with me:</h3>
<p>I am a junior front-end developer with a background in system administration (CISCO) and electronics. In August 2024, I successfully completed my exams at CodeCool as an independent student. Previously, I worked in building automation, specifically coordinating HVAC controls with buildings. I maintained contact with both domestic and international clients and prepared documentation for handovers and training.
IT has always been a central part of my life. It is everywhere around us. I aim to understand this world better and take a more active role in its development.</p>
